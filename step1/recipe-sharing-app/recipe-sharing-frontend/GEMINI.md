# Project Overview

This project is the frontend for a recipe-sharing application. It is built with React and was bootstrapped with Create React App. The main purpose of the application is to allow users to discover and share recipes. Currently, the application features a waitlist signup form to notify users of the official launch.

## Key Technologies

*   **React:** The core of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Create React App:** The project was set up using Create React App, which provides a standardized development environment and build scripts.
*   **CSS:** The application is styled using plain CSS, with styles defined in `App.css` and `index.css`.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Create React App directory structure:

*   `public/`: Contains the main HTML file (`index.html`) and other static assets.
*   `src/`: Contains the main application logic, including the `App.js` component and the entry point `index.js`.
*   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.

# Building and Running

To get the application up and running, you can use the following commands:

*   `npm install`: Installs the project's dependencies.
*   `npm start`: Runs the application in development mode.
*   `npm test`: Runs the application's tests.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.

# Development Conventions

The project follows the standard conventions of a Create React App project. The code is written in JavaScript and uses functional components with hooks. The styling is done using CSS, and the tests are written using React Testing Library.
